##### What is it?

An eCommerce website that allows users to sell their used stuff but with secured payment and meeting location.

##### What differentiate it from sites like Craigslist, Letgo, or other popular selling apps?

On those websites, a usual sale usually involves two people meeting face-to-face with cash as a method of payment. 
However, this is dangerous and very risky since there have been many cases where the buyers get robbed and injured. 
Also, suggesting meeting locations could be a source of revenue for us and also the stores hosting the transaction.
